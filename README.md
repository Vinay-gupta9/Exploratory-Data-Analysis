# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

The primary goal of EDA is to maximize the analyst's insight into a data set and into the underlying structure of a data set, while providing all of the specific items that an analyst would want to extract from a data set, such as: a good-fitting, parsimonious model. a list of outliers. <br>
In this, I had used Student Exam Performace Dataset to perform EDA. <br>
